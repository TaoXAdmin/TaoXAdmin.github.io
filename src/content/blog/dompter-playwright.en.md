Playwright has become one of the go‑to tools for end‑to‑end automation. Its modern syntax and
multi‑browser support make it a great ally. Yet without a rigorous structure a test suite can
quickly turn into a fragile maze that’s slow to run. In this article, I propose a five‑step
approach for building a robust architecture that’s easy to maintain and integrates smoothly into
your continuous integration pipeline.

## 1. Choose the right architecture

Before writing the first line of code it’s essential to define a clear test architecture. **Page
objects** encapsulate UI interactions while your test steps describe the functional journey. This
separation allows you to reuse the same component across scenarios.

```ts
// Simple page object for the login page
export class LoginPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}
  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto('/login');
  }
  async login(username: string, password: string) {
    await this.page.fill('input[name="user"]', username);
    await this.page.fill('input[name="pass"]', password);
    await this.page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  }
}
```

In BDD these page objects are called from step definitions written in Gherkin. Keep your
architecture simple: a `pages` folder for page objects, a `steps` folder for definitions and a
`tests` folder for scenarios.

## 2. Adopt a BDD framework

The second step is to adopt a **behaviour‑driven framework** such as SpecFlow or Cucumber. Gherkin
lets you describe business behaviour in a way all stakeholders can understand. Here’s an example:

```gherkin
Feature: Authentication
  In order to access my account
  As a registered user
  I want to enter my credentials and access my dashboard

  Scenario: Valid login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter my valid username and password
    Then I am redirected to my dashboard
```

Using BDD clarifies the intent of your tests and makes them easier to review. Step definitions
should remain concise and delegate interactions to page objects.

## 3. Modularise and factor components

As your suite grows, the temptation to duplicate code is strong. Instead, group recurring
interactions into **helpers** and centralise configuration. Organise your repository carefully: a
single `playwright.config.ts`, a `fixtures` folder for test data and a utility for dependency
injection. Your productivity will soar.

```
// Example of reusable Playwright configuration
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    headless: true,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
    actionTimeout: 10_000,
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
  },
});
```

## 4. Integrate CI/CD and parallelise

A test suite only has value if it runs regularly. Integrate Playwright into your CI/CD pipeline
(GitHub Actions, GitLab CI or Azure DevOps) and leverage **parallelisation**. Split suites into
**shards** to distribute tests across agents. Use skip annotations to isolate flaky scenarios and a
flakiness reporter to fix them.

In GitHub Actions a simple configuration can launch tests on two containers:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        shard: [1, 2]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install
      - run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/2
```

## 5. Maintain and hunt flakies

Finally, a robust suite requires **regular maintenance**. Put in place test reviews, monitor response
times and identify flaky tests. Tools like the [**Playwright Trace
Viewer**](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) and Grafana dashboards help you investigate.
Additionally, introduce data‑generation scripts using generative models to vary your test sets.

By following these five steps you’ll lay solid foundations for your E2E tests. A good
architecture grows over time: start small, measure, iterate and involve your teams.
